## About

I help teams solve the right problems, make strategic decisions, and build design systems that scale. My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, systems thinking, and hands-on execution — from early research to shipped product.

Recent highlights:
- Doubled autopay enrollment and consolidated 3 fragmented payment systems into one platform for 100K+ customers at America's Car-Mart
- Led point-of-sale redesigns for JCPenney and Follett across retail and enterprise environments
- Design system governance and user research at Walmart (Information Security, Legal, Data Ventures)

I'm currently looking for my next role building teams and shaping product strategy. Connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jaredclark).
