Introduction

My Role: Staff Product Designer leading mobile POS design execution, Persona creation orca wireframes, ui research, and hardware-software integration

On this project, my role was the staff product designer, I worked alongside a principal designer who performed research, and I attended the research workshops to assist with moderating. I perfomed interviews and created real-data-driven Personas of store associates. I was tasked with intaking the research artifacts from the project's JTBD which represented our backlog, and I assisted in the ORCA workshop artifacts by implementing the wireframe stage. 




Challenge

Legacy System Limitations
The client's 20-year-old POS technology creating competitive disadvantage with slow, inflexible workflows that couldn't adapt to modern retail needs.

Operational Inefficiencies
Associates tied to fixed registers with no mobile capabilities, creating bottlenecks and limiting customer service flexibility.

Stakeholder Pain Points
Customers
Long wait times and fragmented experience across online and in-store channels

Sales Associates
Limited mobility and inefficient workflows reducing productivity and customer service quality

Business
High operational costs, competitive disadvantage, and lost sales opportunities


Solution

The intended deliverable was to be an android-based point of sale applicatoin and would be built with GK's omniPOS which laid the foundation for running the solution across JCPenney's approximately 650 locations. 

My primary role was to design the product User Interface and Point of Sale Experience to provide acceptance criteria for our dev team to build out the UI. The client had an internal design system for their consumer facing products, which we used to gather insights about the brand and any design guidelines we should follow. 

I then created a new design library in Figma, and relied heavily on design tokens implemented with Figma Variables. I created design deliverables for the point of sale implementation in a separate Figma file with it's own variables for interactivity, and most successfully, to map real product data from JCP's systems into the prototype. With this data, and by writing variable functions, I was prototype the orchestration of multiple screens in the Point of sale experience between both the associate and the customer. 

With Figma interactive variables, the prototype was built to maintain the correct cart total, so stakeholders could use the prototype to understand the experience without being locked into the traditional paths drawn by a designer. I created components from individual primitives all the way up to complete pages that would render on the client devices and so this combined with the interactive variables, and design tokens from the library. 

This allowed me to create a single prototype deliverable where stakeholders could select from a subset of their actual products, and as they added and removed items to their cart, product prices, taxes, discounts, and other price factors were considered so that "the math will math" and the experience can be viewed at this prototype level. 

With all of my page components, I was able to prototype individual JTBD on separate Figma Pages, and with Figma's variable modes, I could provide our development team with individual links for every Job To Be Done by the system actors.

From JCPenney's Head of Design complimented the design of our solution and was impressed at our research + design connective tissue, and the way the implementation was architected in Figma. 
"The fact that this solution was designed and prototyped in this way by a single person is insane. We will be implementing the strategy across our design organization as we build and iterate on future designs."
