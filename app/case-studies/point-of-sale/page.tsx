            <p>
              JCPenney's point of sale hadn't been touched since 2004. Associates were tethered to fixed registers, unable to help customers on the floor. Online and in-store systems didn't talk to each other. The credit application process took so long customers would abandon purchases mid-transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company needed more than a facelift—they needed a complete platform transformation: new network infrastructure, new hardware, new software, and a mobile-first approach that would let associates meet customers anywhere in the store.
            </p>
            <p>
              I joined a cross-functional team spanning three workstreams: a mobile pilot program, a "checkout of the future" design effort, and a lab proof-of-concept comparing hardware vendors. My focus was Workstream 2: designing the future checkout experience for both associates and customers.

          <h2 className="mb-6">Discovery: Understanding 86 Ways to Do a Job</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              The retailer's checkout process wasn't one job—it was dozens. Cash management alone had 23 distinct tasks. Returns, exchanges, tax compliance, specialty departments like Fine Jewelry and Salon—each had their own workflows, edge cases, and frustrations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-foreground pt-4">Contextual Inquiry</h3>
            <p>
              We spent time in stores with associates at their registers. I set up a camera on a tripod to capture actual screen states during transactions—not staged demos, but real workflows with real friction. We interviewed cashiers, supervisors, and specialty associates to understand not just what they did, but why existing workarounds existed.
            </p>
            <p>
              One cashier showed us how she'd developed her own system for handling BOGO promotions because the POS couldn't calculate multi-item discounts. A Fine Jewelry supervisor explained why she kept customer information in a separate notebook instead of the system. These weren't user errors—they were signals that the current system had failed them.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-foreground pt-4">Jobs-to-Be-Done Workshops</h3>
            <p>
              We facilitated workshops with 27 cross-functional partners from Accounting, Tax, Customer Care, Store Ops, and a dozen other departments. The goal was to surface every job an associate might need to complete through the POS, then cluster them into themes and define success metrics for each.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workshops produced 86 distinct jobs-to-be-done across 13 categories: Core Checkout, Cash Management, Returns, Tax Compliance, Administration, Training, and more. For each job, we captured the situation, motivation, and expected outcome—creating a research foundation that would drive every design decision.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-foreground pt-4">Four Personas, Validated</h3>
            <p>
              The client came to us with two proto-personas representing a young part-timer and another to represent their veteran associates. Through interviews and surveys, we expanded and validated these into four research-backed personas:

          <h2 className="mb-6">Design System: Built Solo, Designed to Scale</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              JCPenney had marketing components for their e-commerce site but no true design system. The GK platform we were building on used SAP's design language, but the client wanted something they could own and extend across future products.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a flexible timeline, I took on building a complete design system from the ground up.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-foreground pt-4">The Approach</h3>
            <p>
              I started with design tokens as Figma variables—colors, typography, spacing—then worked upward through primitives to application-level components. Every component was built with auto-layout for responsive behavior across the mobile M60 device and docked desktop display.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than maintain separate files, I built a monolithic Figma workspace organized by component type: atoms, molecules, application components, page templates, and interactive prototypes. This let me iterate quickly while keeping the technical team's source of truth in one place.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-foreground pt-4">The Components</h3>
            <p>
              The system included everything needed for a complete POS experience:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Transaction line items with configurable states (regular, sale, clearance, return)</li>
              <li>Payment method selectors supporting cash, card, check, and gift card</li>
              <li>Customer lookup and rewards integration</li>
              <li>Till management interfaces for cash counting and reconciliation</li>
              <li>Specialty workflows for Fine Jewelry, Salon appointments, and BOPIS fulfillment</li>

            <p>
              When I presented the design system to JCPenney's internal UX team, their lead designer jokingly interrogated me about whether I had a hidden team of designers helping. He appreciated how the system integrated their existing brand while being flexible enough for multiple product contexts—and that every component actually worked with auto-layout.

                The ELO M60 device could be used handheld on the sales floor or docked at a fixed terminal with a larger touchscreen. Rather than designing two separate experiences, I created a responsive system where the same UI adapted to context.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                On the floor, associates could scan items, look up inventory, and even complete transactions. At the dock, the M60 screen flipped to face customers for signature capture and payment input while associates used the larger display for complex operations like returns and exchanges.

              <h3 className="text-foreground">Journey Maps at Scale</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                We needed to document current and future state journeys for all 86 jobs-to-be-done—a massive documentation challenge. I built a Figma component system specifically for journey mapping, where each step was a configurable component that could expand to accommodate any workflow length using auto-layout.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                This let the research team rapidly document journeys while maintaining visual consistency. Each map captured associate actions, customer touchpoints, emotional states, and proposed changes—becoming the specification that drove development priorities.

              <h3 className="text-foreground">Mapping UI to System Objects</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Through our ORCA workshops, we'd mapped the relationships between business objects: Customer, Transaction, Tender, Item, Associate, and their attributes and connections. I used this object model to structure the UI, ensuring every component had a clear relationship to backend data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                This alignment meant developers could look at a Figma prototype and immediately understand what data needed to flow where. It reduced ambiguity in handoffs and caught integration issues early—before they became expensive rework.

              This project taught me the value of research infrastructure. The 86 jobs-to-be-done we documented weren't just artifacts—they became the language the entire cross-functional team used to discuss priorities, make tradeoffs, and measure success.

              Building the design system solo under timeline pressure forced clarity about what components actually needed to do versus what would be nice to have. Every auto-layout decision, every variant, had to earn its place.

              Most importantly, I learned how to co-lead workshops that respected stakeholders' time while extracting the information we needed. When you're in a room with 27 people from 14 departments, every minute matters. The preparation—the component templates, the facilitation plan, the follow-up documentation—made the difference between a productive session and an expensive meeting.
