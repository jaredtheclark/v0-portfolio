              America's Car-Mart operates 150+ dealerships serving 100,000+ customers with in-house financing. Their
              payments infrastructure was fractured across multiple legacy systems with no unified source of truth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              I was brought in to architect the UX strategy for an enterprise-wide payments modernization. Eight weeks
              in, leadership pivoted: ship a customer-facing payments platform by June 1, or miss a critical financial
              audit window.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-2">Reframed the problem under pressure.</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                When the timeline compressed, I carved out the customer-critical Jobs to Be Done from the broader
                research and built a focused product strategy that could actually ship.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-2">Enabled a team to move fast without breaking things.</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Before bringing in a senior designer, I stood up the design system, documented the workflow, and synthesized
                each requirement with business and technical context. This enabled them to deliver a working demo by the end of their first week.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                When the CTO bypassed our process to push a deceptive pattern directly to development, I intervened. I
                uncovered the actual business need behind the ask, designed a solution that served both customers and the
                business goal, and built the executive communication strategy to sell it. The result: 200% higher adoption
                than projected—without the deceptive pattern.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Coached the team through usability studies with store managers, customer service associates, and actual
                customers. We recorded sessions and used the findings to reinforce design decisions to skeptical stakeholders.

            Launched a zero-to-one payments platform in four months—on a timeline leadership said couldn't be
